Weather Rescue Table
====================

An app to assist in transcribing observations for the [Weather Rescue](https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/edh/weather-rescue) project.

Weather Rescue Table (WRT) provides a table into which you can transcribe the weather observations. After checking for possible errors, it creates output that you can paste into the boxes on the Weather Rescue site.

Open the [table](https://sktw.github.io/weather-rescue-table/table).  
Read the [documentation](https://sktw.github.io/weather-rescue-table/docs).

Features
--------

- Checks that the right number of values have been entered for a given column, and that the values have the correct type.
- Lets you see the whole transcription before submitting it. This reduces the chances of accidentally transcribing the same column twice.
- Provides keyboard shortcuts for uncertain, blank and unclear values, and automatically inserts decimal points.
